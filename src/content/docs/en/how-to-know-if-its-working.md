Once you've installed the Penkle Analytics snippet on your website, you'll want to verify that it's working correctly. Here are a few ways to check.

Navigate to the real-time dashboard within your Penkle Analytics account. Here, you can monitor incoming traffic in real-time, providing visual confirmation that data is being captured from your website visitors as they interact with your site.

Another way to verify that the snippet is working is to visit your website and interact with it. You should see your activity reflected in the real-time dashboard, confirming that the snippet is capturing data accurately.

If you're still unsure whether the snippet is working correctly, you can use your browser's developer tools to inspect the network requests. Look for requests to `penkle.com` to confirm that the snippet is loading and sending data to our servers.

If you're having trouble verifying that the snippet is working, please don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:sales@penkle.com) for assistance.
