title: Installing the Snippet
description: Learn how to install and setup the snippet
---

If you haven't already, you'll need to <a href="https://penkle.com/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=install-snippet" target="_blank">register</a> for an account. Once you've registered, you'll be able to add your website and get your tracking snippet.

Please omit the `https://` from your domain name, and include any subdomains. For example, if your website is `https://www.example.com`, you should enter `www.example.com` in the snippet.

It should look something like this:

```html
<script
  async
  defer
  data-domain="yourdomain.com"
  src="https://penkle.com/scripts/penkle.min.js"
></script>
```

You'll need to replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain. Once you've added the snippet to your website, you'll be able to see your traffic in real-time on your dashboard. If you have any questions, feel free to [contact us](mailto:sales@penkle.com).
